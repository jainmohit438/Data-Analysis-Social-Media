Problem statement

The current report explores various aspects associated with the social networking accounts like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin.And tries to find out 
whether account can be considered fake or not! The specific research questions explained in this study are as follows:
1.	Relation between profile pic with fake accounts through graph and mathematical observations.
2.	Relation between follows with fake accounts through graph and mathematical observations.
3.	Relation between followers with fake accounts through graph and mathematical observations.
4.	Relation between Username along with different scenarios with fake accounts through graph and mathematical observations.
5.	Relation between External URL along with different scenarios with fake accounts through graph and mathematical observations.
6.	Relation between Posts along with different scenarios with fake accounts through graph and mathematical observations.
   
Imported Libraries 
1.import pandas as pd   -  Pandas is a library created to help developers work with "labeled" and "relational" data intuitively. 
2.import numpy as np    - NumPy (Numerical Python) is a perfect tool for scientific computing and performing basic and advanced array operations.
3.import seaborn as sns -  Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and serves as a useful Python machine learning tool for visualizing statistical models – heatmaps and other types of                                 visualizations that summarize data and depict the overall distributions. 
4.import matplotlib.pyplot as plt -This is a standard data science library that helps to generate data visualizations such as two-dimensional diagrams and graphs



Datasets
1.	Insta_fake1
2.	Insta_fake2


Conclusion

In this analysis, I explored the data sets and find out the relationship between two columns graphically and mathematically .I observed that 
1.Accounts with more profile pic have less probability to be fake and if account is private also then probability of account being faked further decreases.
2. Accounts with more follows have less chances of being in fake if account is private also then probability of account being faked further decreases.
3. Accounts with more followers have less chances of being in fake if account is private also then probability of account being faked further decreases.
4. Accounts with more “name=username” have less chances of being in fake if account is private also then probability of account being faked further decreases.
5. Accounts with more External URL have less chances of being in fake if account is private also then probability of account being faked further decreases.

I have learnt a lot about libraries, Datasets and plotting of graph with mathematical computation.
